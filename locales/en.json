      {
        "q": "How does BuyWise Spain save me money?",
        "a": "We negotiate directly with the listing agency to lower your purchase price before you sign any contracts. By redirecting a portion of the seller’s commission back to you, we ensure immediate savings on your final price."
      },
      {
        "q": "Can BuyWise Spain support me at every step of the buying process?",
        "a": "Absolutely. We offer full 360° buyer representation, from price negotiation and legal guidance to mortgage support. We coordinate with lawyers and lenders to make the process seamless."
      },
      {
        "q": "I’ve already visited the property. Can you still help me?",
        "a": "If you’ve already signed an offer or reservation agreement, our ability to negotiate on your behalf may be limited. It’s best to reach out before you commit so we can secure maximum savings."
      },
      {
        "q": "What payment options are available for the cashback or discount?",
        "a": "We offer the savings as a direct reduction on the final purchase price or as a separate cashback refund after closing. The seller covers our buyer’s agent commission, and you choose the modality that works best for you."
      },
      {
        "q": "Where does BuyWise Spain operate?",
        "a": "We operate nationally across Spain, with a focus on the Costa del Sol and major cities. We serve both English-speaking expats and local buyers throughout the country."
